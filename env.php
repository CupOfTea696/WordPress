/**
 * Environment Detection
 * 
 * Use this file to write logic to detect which environment file
 * the application should use. Select a file name by
 * returning a string. Make sure to check if
 * the file you want to use exists.
 * 
 * The base_path() helper is already available.
 * 
 * Example usage:
 * 
 * if (preg_match('/(^localhost|\\.local)$/', $host) && file_exists(base_path('.env.local'))) {
 *     return '.env.local';
 * }
 *
